A university for everyone

On BlindDate, students with disabilities offer insights into their everyday university life. Concrete recommendations for action help you reduce barriers in your own teaching.

We use personas to portray students with disabilities. Personas are fictional characters that represent a target group with specific characteristics. In our case, they reflect the diverse realities of students with disabilities. These personas are not purely fictional; they are grounded in real data collected through surveys, personal stories, and feedback from students over the course of the SHUFFLE project.

We have therefore chosen the CC BY-ND 4.0 Deed license to ensure that the real experiences and statements of the students are not altered or misrepresented.

The project was implemented using SvelteKit ♥️
